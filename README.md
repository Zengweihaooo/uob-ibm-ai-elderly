# üß† AI for the Elderly ‚Äì UoB √ó IBM Summer Project 2025

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our 2025 University of Bristol √ó IBM collaboration project: **AI for the Elderly**.  
This project explores how intelligent agents and virtual companions can help reduce social isolation among older adults through emotionally engaging digital experiences.

## üéØ Problem Statement & School-Provided Brief

> *(Provided by the University of Bristol & IBM mentor team)*

As the pace of technologically enabled social engagement grows, the elderly become more and more left behind despite the consumability and capability of the technology. This results in increasing isolation, loneliness and ill health.  

We need a **‚ÄòSocial Pet‚Äô** that encourages the user to engage whilst keeping them connected to the outside world.

## üß© Concept Goals

Create a **mobile phone-based ‚Äòpet‚Äô** that responds to voice and interaction. The more the user interacts, the "happier" the pet becomes. The goal is to form an emotional bond between the user and the assistant.

The pet should also serve **practical and emotional functions**, such as:

1. **Routine check-in** ‚Äì Monitor user schedule (e.g. breakfast by 8am). If the user isn‚Äôt detected, call out; if no response, alert carer/family.
2. **Daily reflection** ‚Äì Ask about their day and encourage light planning.
3. **Personalized media** ‚Äì Ask for interests (music, radio, hobbies) and recommend podcasts or content, offering playback reminders.
4. **Family messaging bridge** ‚Äì Family can text/tweet the pet; the pet reads messages aloud and helps user respond via speech-to-text.
5. **Proactive engagement** ‚Äì Pet makes sounds in the morning to invite interaction.
6. **Emotional animation** ‚Äì Visually/audibly express happiness or sadness depending on interaction frequency. (*No physical mobility required.*)

**Inspiration**: [Twitch robotic pet example](http://www.instructables.com/id/Twitch-Your-Robotic-Pet/)

Due to current constraints, we aim to develop a **virtual pet app** (tablet/mobile-based) instead of a physical robot.

## üß† Tech Stack (Planned)

- **IBM Watson Assistant**
- **Watson Speech to Text & Text to Speech**
- Unity or Web-based interaction platform
- Possibly: Node.js / React / Python backend support

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Note

> *A novel application area around digital companionship that we feel has plenty of room for expanding the challenge. Be warned that ethical clearance for running studies with the elderly is non-trivial. Your team may be required to make more design decisions without client input.*
