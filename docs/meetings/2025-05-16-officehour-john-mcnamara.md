Please ensure that all team emails follow the SOPv2 guidelines:

### 2. Introductory Video  
Each team is required to prepare a **short introductory video** (~1–2 minutes) presenting:

💡 _We can coordinate a time to film or compile this together._

### 3. Mentor Scheduling & Time Zone Conflicts  
Given the mentors are in different time zones (IST and EDT), we are encouraged to:
- Hold separate sync meetings if needed  
- Summarise and share outcomes between mentors via Teams/Docs
